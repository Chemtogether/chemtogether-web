      requirements, planning, discussions with the equipment suppliers, authoring and

      the recruitment phase, I realized Bachem is a fast-growing company where I would
      be able to start working with almost no industry experience on challenging and
      innovative projects relevant to production processes. I also had a very positive
      impression of the people I would be working with.
      I applied through Bachemâ€™s careers portal by submitting standard job application
      documents (CV, motivation letter, certificates etc.) and was invited for a first in-person
      interview with my future supervisors as well as HR partner. After I successfully made
      it to the next stage, I was invited to a second round. This time I met the rest of the
      team, got an insight into how the company operates and what my potential projects
      might look like. In the end, I had the opportunity to present a topic of my choice to a
      group of Bachem colleagues from the same department.',

      and communicate with different collaborators in order to achieve the goal. Apart from
      that, my studies at ETH gave me a very solid theoretical and practical knowledge in
      the field of chemical engineering.',

      this chance also for going abroad in order to meet other cultures as well as working
