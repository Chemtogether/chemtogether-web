      requirements, planning, discussions with the equipment suppliers, authoring and

      the recruitment phase, I realized Bachem is a fast-growing company where I would
      be able to start working with almost no industry experience on challenging and
      innovative projects relevant to production processes. I also had a very positive
      impression of the people I would be working with.
      I applied through Bachemâ€™s careers portal by submitting standard job application
      documents (CV, motivation letter, certificates etc.) and was invited for a first in-person
      interview with my future supervisors as well as HR partner. After I successfully made
      it to the next stage, I was invited to a second round. This time I met the rest of the
      team, got an insight into how the company operates and what my potential projects
      might look like. In the end, I had the opportunity to present a topic of my choice to a
      group of Bachem colleagues from the same department.',

      and communicate with different collaborators in order to achieve the goal. Apart from
      that, my studies at ETH gave me a very solid theoretical and practical knowledge in
      the field of chemical engineering.',

      this chance also for going abroad in order to meet other cultures as well as working
      styles and conditions. Sometimes they really vary from what one can experience at
